// MATH DATA TYPES
// int, float, double

// An int is an integer - a whole number.
int aPositiveNumber = 5;
int aNegativeNumber = -5;
int zeroIsAValidInt = 0;

// A float is a decimal number - a "floating point" number.
// If the number is NOT zero, we must add an "f" to the end of the number, as it's different from other decimal numbers.

float aPositiveFloat = 5.0f;
float aNegativeFloat = -10.5f;
float zeroIsAValidFloat = 0;

// A double is LIKE a float - it's also a decimal number.
// HOWEVER, a double takes up TWICE the memory in the program and is more precise!
// Doubles do NOT need the "f" at the end.

// char is for character - a single letter in ''
